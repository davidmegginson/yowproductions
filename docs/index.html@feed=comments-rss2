		<description><![CDATA[Hi, Ikester! 

So sorry you missed the broadcast. We hope it will be on air again, but are not sure when yet. There is also a possibility that CBC will eventually put it online. We will certainly let people know when they do. Best bet is to contact CBC through &quot;Absolutely Canadian&quot; and let them know you&#039;d like to see the show. The more positive response they receive, the more likely it is they will rebroadcast it!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your feedback! We are waiting to see if CBC picks it up Nationally or makes it available on the CBC web site. We will certainly let you know when it will next be broadcast, or when it is available. In the meantime, you can e-mail CBC Ottawa and let them know you would like to see the documentary. Mail to:  cbcottawa.arts[at]cbc.ca]]></description>
