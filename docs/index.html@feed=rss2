				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday evening marked the pitch session for the 2012 Digi60 Festival. As an invited filmmaker, working with Mountain Road Productions, I was excited to hear the 12 filmmakers pitch different ideas for the catch: &#8220;reunion&#8221;, with the added challenge of beginning or ending the film with a rhyming couplet.</p>
<p>The pitches were varied: dark science fiction, comic horror, black comedy, drama. In the end we decided to go with a comedy, and I am looking forward to working with the writer to see where the pitched idea can take us.</p>
<p>There was a lot of creative energy in the room, and the process promises to be a very exciting and fun one!</p>
