				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friday evening marked the pitch session for the 2012 Digi60 Festival. As an invited filmmaker, working with Mountain Road Productions, I was excited to hear the 12 filmmakers pitch different ideas for the catch: &#8220;reunion&#8221;, with the added challenge of beginning or ending the film with a rhyming couplet.</p>
<p>The pitches were varied: dark science fiction, comic horror, black comedy, drama. In the end we decided to go with a comedy, and I am looking forward to working with the writer to see where the pitched idea can take us.</p>
<p>There was a lot of creative energy in the room, and the process promises to be a very exciting and fun one!</p>

<p>BWMF is the world&#8217;s largest global development and production marketplace, and has been attracting international producers of television/media content to Banff since 1979.</p>
<p>The BANFF International Pilots Competition gives producers an opportunity to get their project in front of industry executives. Entered pilots are judged by juries composed of leading broadcast and production executives from around the world.</p>
<p>“I am so excited to have been chosen to compete at Banff,” says Bonnie Robinson, the creator and producer of Sweet Tarts Takeaway. “Just becoming a finalist is a huge boost to the Ottawa Arts scene, since everyone involved in the project, from cast to crew to musicians, is a resident of the Ottawa-Gatineau area.”</p>
<p>Robinson, accompanied by Ottawa actor Jerome Bourgault (who plays Dan in the series), will attend the Pilots Competition ceremony in Banff on Monday, June 13. “I am looking forward to the competition, and to exposing Sweet Tarts Takeaway to a larger international audience,” says Robinson. “It looks like we are the only comedy in the Entertainment Category, which includes game shows and reality TV programming. This is phenomenal exposure for our show. “</p>

<p>Bonnie Robinson, the creator and producer of Sweet Tarts Takeaway, submitted the series for consideration, and was thrilled when it earned enough votes to make it into the second round. “This is a very exciting time to be producing a Web Series, as the genre is still relatively new,” she says. “It is great to be recognized by the New Media Film Festival, and to expose Sweet Tarts to a larger audience, and the wider entertainment industry.”<br />
Considered “Sundance for the Facebook crowd” the New Media Film Festival honours the best in New Media, from web series, to Apps to 3D Animation. Finalists for the Audience Choice Award (which is sponsored by Mingle Media TV, an online media and live web TV network company) have their web series screened at the NMFF and will have a final audience vote off during the last two weeks prior to the NMFF in May 2011 to select a winner. The winner and 5 finalists will receive an award certificate and be eligible for cash prizes.</p>
